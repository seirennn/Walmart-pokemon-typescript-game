# 🎮 Pokemon from wish typescript game


## 🌟 What's This?
Monster Battler is a totally-not-a-Pokemon-clone terminal-based game built with TypeScript. "

## 🚀 Features

- 🔥 Four elemental types: Fire (for the hot-headed), Water (for the chill ones), Earth (for the down-to-earth), and Air (for those who are full of it)
- 🎨 Beautiful ASCII art that will make you say "Wow, that kind of looks like a monster if I squint!"
- 🎯 Turn-based battles that are totally balanced (we think)
- 🌈 Colorful terminal output because black and white is so 1980s
- 🎲 Random opponents that are definitely not controlled by a very basic AI

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Clone this repo 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/seirennn/Alibaba-Pokemon-typescript-game.git
```

2. Install dependencies (because we're too lazy to write everything from scratch)
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the game
```bash
npm start
```

## 🤔 Game Commands
- Type your monster's name (please be more creative than "Monstey McMosterface")
- Choose your element (choose wisely, or don't, we're not your parents)
- Battle! (spam moves until something happens)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- TypeScript (because JavaScript wasn't complicated enough)
- Node.js (because browsers are overrated)
- ASCII Art (because who needs Unity when you have `/\\/\`)
- Your Terminal (the OG gaming platform)

## 🤓 For Developers
Yes, this is actually written in TypeScript. No, we don't know why either. But hey, at least you get:
- Type safety (because `undefined is not a function` is so 2015)
- Interfaces 
- Classses

## 🎵 System Requirements
- A terminal (preferably one that can display colors)
- Node.js (the newer the better)
- The ability to type


## 🙏 Acknowledgments
- Pokemon, for being the obvious inspiration for this
- Our terminal, for putting up with our ASCII art
- Coffee, for making this possible
- You, for actually reading this README

## 🐛 Known Issues
- The game is not actually Pokemon
- ASCII art might look weird on some terminals (that's a feature, not a bug)
- The AI is about as intelligent as a rubber duck (no offense to rubber ducks)
